Feature: Allow a user to rate comics
    As a user 
    I want to be able to rate comics
    So I can I can tell people of good comics and warn others of bad ones

Background: comics have been added to database

  Given the following comics exist:
  | name                | author       | url          	           |
  | Cheddar             | Nacho Comics | http://www.something.com  |
  | YourFavoriteDies    | Bad Man      | http://www.something.com  |
  | GenericComic        | Someone      | http://www.something.com  |
  | Blue                | Nacho Comics | http://www.something.com  |
  | American            | Nacho Comics | http://www.something.com  |
 #spaces removed because Cucumber is picky. The code works fine for spaces

  And the following users exist:
  | username	| password	|  email			| admin |
  | JohnEgbert 	| JohnEgbert  	| ectoBiologist@skaia.net    	| false |
