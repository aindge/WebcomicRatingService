Feature: Allow a user to make claims
	As a user
	I want to claim a comic
	So no one can mess up my stuff

Background: Things exist
	Given the following comics exist:
  | name                | author       | url                       |
  | Cheddar             | Nacho Comics | http://www.something.com  |
  | YourFavoriteDies    | Bad Man      | http://www.something.com  |
  | GenericComic        | Someone      | http://www.something.com  |
 #spaces removed because Cucumber is picky. The code works fine for spaces

  | username	| password	| email				| admin |
