Iteration 4-1 Document 1

Feature: Sort comics by rank
As a newbie to online comics
I want to sort comics by their rating
So that I can find the best comic to start off with.

Feature: Rate comics
As an admin of WebComics Rating Service
I want rating comics to be limited to users
So that admin can't skew data

Feature: Edit and delete comic listings
As an admin of WebComics Rating Service
I want to be able to edit and delete comic listings
So that I can maintain the database

Of these stories, two were from our initial meeting with our customers. The final one, the edit and delete one, is merely an extension of the log in one. When we talked to our customers, they affirmed that this is what they wanted for this iteration. They also made an additional request, but it was not possible to include that in the duration of one iteration.
